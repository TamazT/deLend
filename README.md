# Inspiration

Millions of individuals globally cannot access and benefit from DeFi and the web3 space due to the high knowledge threshold for entry and poor user experience.
So, our inspiration is to build a platform where people can deposit their stables for the best interest rate in DeFi without extensive knowledge of the industry as quickly and simply as possible.

# What it does

DeLend aggregates the best interest rates for stablecoins in Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism blockchains. The application will deposit your funds in one click at the best interest rate on the market.

# Example

Best APY - DAI in Optimism (AAVE protocol)
User have USDT in Ethereum.
After pressing the button deposit in DeLend, the application will:

1. Bridge DAI from Ethereum to Optimism
2. Swap USDT for DAI in Optimism blockchain
3. Deposit DAI into AAVE at Optimism

We saved the user's time from:

- finding the best interest rate on the market
- finding a bridge to transfer funds
- Dexex search for token exchange
